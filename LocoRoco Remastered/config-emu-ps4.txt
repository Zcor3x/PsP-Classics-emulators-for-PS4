; Redirect host0: to a another directory (uncomment to enable).
; By default it's mapped to the working directory where the executable starts
;--host="D:\Sony\PSPHD"

; To dump the original video in PMF format, uncomment the --dumpvideos line
; For example, with the current setting, it will save them in a "D:\Sony\PSPHD\videos" directory (make sure the directory exists)
;--dumpvideos="host0:videos"

; To dump the original audio in Atrac3 format, uncomment the --dumpaudio line
; For example, with the current setting, it will save them in a "D:\Sony\PSPHD\audio" directory (make sure the directory exists)
;--dumpaudio="host0:audio"

; To save the in-game textures as the game runs, uncomment the --texsave line
; For example, with the current setting, it will save them in a "D:\Sony\PSPHD\texdump" directory (make sure the directory exists)
;--texsave="host0:texdump"
;--texmissingsave="host0:texdump"


; To replace specific textures as the game runs, uncomment the --texreplace line
; For example, with the current setting, it will load them from the "D:\Sony\PSPHD\texreplace" directory
; If the --scale setting is set to 4 or 8, the program will also look for replacement textures on '4x' or '8x' directories within this directory
--texreplace="host0:texreplace"

; This forces alpha blending to on for replaced textures. (uncomment to enable)
; With this we can freely make use of a normal alpha channel on replacement textures
--replacementalpha=true

; This enables bilinear filtering on replaced textures. (uncomment to enable)
--replacementfilter=true

; Enable switching between original and replacement textures at runtime using the L3 button on a DS4 or the 'T' key on Windows
--texswitch=true

; Antialiasing mode. SSAA4x looks best, MSAA4x only smooths edges.
; Choices: off, SSAA4x, MSAA4x
; Supersampling is not very important for this game, but MSAA makes a difference.
--antialias=SSAA4x

; Turns on the auto-resampler. Assumes textures in texreplace are at 8x resolution and resamples them at load

; LocoRoco texture cache mode.
--texcachemode=drawboundsloco

; Decompress replacement textures on demand
;    launch: Fully load and decompress all textures on launch.
;    ondemand: Load on launch, decompress on first use. This should enable using enourmous amounts of textures on NEO, but does stutter a bit.

;Support for multiple savgames

; X/O button mode. "oenter" sets Circle as enter, "xenter" sets Cross as enter. If not present/enabled, it's selected by the system language (Asian
; languages default to oenter, everything else "xenter"). Notice this only works when the game queries the PSP OS for the button configuration.
