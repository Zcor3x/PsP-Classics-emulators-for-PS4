; To dump the original video in PMF format, uncomment the --dumpvideos line
; For example, with the current setting, it will save them in a "D:\Sony\PSPHD\videos" directory (make sure the directory exists)
;--dumpvideos="host0:videos"

; To dump the original audio in Atrac3 format, uncomment the --dumpaudio line
; For example, with the current setting, it will save them in a "D:\Sony\PSPHD\audio" directory (make sure the directory exists)
;--dumpaudio="host0:audio"

; To save the in-game textures as the game runs, uncomment the --texsave line
; For example, with the current setting, it will save them in a "D:\Sony\PSPHD\texdump" directory (make sure the directory exists)
;--texsave="host0:texdump"

; To replace specific textures as the game runs, uncomment the --texreplace line
; For example, with the current setting, it will load them from the "D:\Sony\PSPHD\texreplace" directory
; If the --scale setting is set to 4 or 8, the program will also look for replacement textures on '4x' or '8x' directories within this directory
